# chat-app
This is a chat application built using PHP, HTML, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL.

## Technologies Used

- PHP
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- MySQL

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed XAMPP or a similar local server environment that supports PHP and MySQL.
- You have a basic understanding of PHP, MySQL, and web development.

## Setting Up the Project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project folder.

2. Place the project folder in your XAMPP's `htdocs` directory.

3. Start your XAMPP server (Apache and MySQL).

4. Import the database:
   - Open phpMyAdmin (usually at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`)
   - Create a new database (use the name specified in the `connection.php` file)
   - Import the SQL file provided in the project (if available) or manually create the necessary tables based on the schema used in the PHP files.

5. Configure the database connection:
   - Open the `connection.php` file
   - Update the database credentials if necessary to match your local MySQL setup

## Running the Application

To run the application:

1. Ensure your XAMPP server is running.

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/[project-folder-name]`, replacing `[project-folder-name]` with the name of the folder containing the project files.

3. You should now be able to access and use the chat application.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to configure your PHP environment correctly, especially if you're using features that require specific PHP extensions.
- If you encounter any issues with Tailwind CSS, ensure that the Tailwind CSS file is properly linked in your HTML files.
